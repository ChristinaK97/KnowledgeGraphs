GDP is also equal to the sum of personal consumption expenditures, gross private domestic investment, net exports of goods and services, and government consumption expenditures and gross investment. Conceptually, this measure can be arrived at by three separate means: as the sum of goods and services sold to final users, as the sum of income payments and other costs incurred in the production of goods and services, and as the sum of the value added at each stage of production. Although these three ways of measuring GDP are conceptually the same, their calculation may not result in identical estimates of GDP because of differences in data sources, timing, and estimation techniques." .

A classification scheme may be a taxonomy, a network, an ontology, or any other terminological system. Such classification schemes are intended to permit the classification of arbitrary objects into hierarchies, or partial orders, as appropriate. The classification may also be just a list of controlled vocabulary of property words (or terms). The list might be taken from the 'leaf level' of a taxonomy." .

Lender rights are: - expressed in the Contract Consumer protection develops becaues the contract is written by the potential Lender. So the rights are introcued to rectify the imbalance between the two parties. Same goes for insurance. consumer protection laws (governe dby the relevant consumer protection agency. So the lender protexts itself as it writes th contract AND does the things it needs to do to protext itself, but on the approval process, and with later instruments such as insurance. Interestingly., it is the Borrower who pays for this by paying for credit reports etc. So the borrower protects itself by other mechanisms. Caveat emptor - displaced by regulation (the buyer is protected by regulation). Uberimae Fidae - in the utmost good faith. Mortgage Insurance is an additional means of mitigating the risk, that the lended may have., so if the information assessed is not accurate, or if the borrower's situation changes for the worse. then the risk rating may go down. So the Mortgage Insurance is a further strategy which mitigates any shortfall in the Lender Righrs that you may have - ie someone guarantees. In the US you can also avoid that by having paid a deposit. PIMI: Principal, Interst and Morgage Insurance. So the Borrower pays towards the MI, esxcept if they have paid a given amount as deposit. there are 2 types of MI: 1. protects the lender in the event of borrower degault 2. Insurance for \"Incapacity to pay the mortage\" (these can be bought off the shelf - can combine health, unemployment etc.). - this is the Borrower mitigating their own risk. Prevents foreclosure. Similar to general sickness etc. Where the lender charges for MI, the cost is passed onto the Borrower. e.g. if there is a % valuation (e.g. 70% in Aus, 80% in US for example) then no insurance is required."@en .

                "Swap cashflows are known as Swapstreams and are the terms for payment to and from either party. These are defined in swap transaction messages and represent the terms of the contract implied by that transaction. Options (Nordea reviews): Cashflows are defined as Payouts. This is not the same as a model of a cashflow which is a consequence of applying some legal term for payment of interest or principal, but is a commitment expressed in purely cashflow terms. Review this though. Payout terms include: Values - values can only go up or down; Static values are defined for limits and the like. i.e. Constraints (and direction) - this covers caps and floors - these are read upward or downward Conditionality Formula relations (Input and Output): - these are values - these may have a cap or a floor on them also - these also may have Multiplication - there is also fixed margin - may have addition or substraction between these Linearity in covered in the above Timing / expiry Observaton (not terms): Probability Sensitivity" .

The third (right-most) character of the identifier (alphabetic code) is an indicator derived from the name of the major currency unit or fund. If the currency is not associated with a single geographical entity as described in ISO 3166-1, typically a specially allocated identifier (alpha-2 code) is used to describe the currency authority. This code has been allocated by the Maintenance Agency from within the user-assigned range of codes XA to XZ specified in 8.1.3 of ISO 3166-1:2013.

Stock exchanges also provide facilities for the issue and redemption of securities as well as other financial instruments and capital events including the payment of income and dividends.\n\nThe securities traded on a stock exchange include: shares issued by companies, unit trusts, derivatives, pooled investment products and bonds. To be able to trade a security on a certain stock exchange, it has to be listed there. Usually there is a central location at least for recordkeeping, but trade is less and less linked to such a physical place, as modern markets are electronic networks, which gives them advantages of speed and cost of transactions.

Howey Co., 328 U.S. 293, 90 L.Ed. 1244, 66 S.Ct. 1100 (1946), the Court held that land sales contracts for citrus groves in Florida, coupled with warranty deeds for the land and a contract to service the land, were 'investment contracts' and thus securities. The Court stated that [a]n investment contract for purposes of the Securities Act means a contract, transaction or scheme whereby a person invests his money in a common enterprise and is led to expect profits solely from the efforts of the promoter or a third party. 66 S.Ct. at 1103. According to the Court, it is immaterial whether the shares in the enterprise are evidenced by formal certificates or by nominal interests in the physical assets employed in the enterprise. 66 S.Ct. at 1104." , "A security can be any note, stock, treasury stock, security future, security-based swap, bond, debenture,certificate of interest or participation in any profit-sharing agreement or in any oil, gas, or other mineral royalty or lease, any collateral-trust certificate, preorganization certificate or subscription, transferable share, investment contract, voting-trust certificate, certificate of deposit for a security, any put, call, straddle, option, or privilege on any security, certificate of deposit, or group or index of securities (including any interest therein or based on the value thereof), or any put, call, straddle, option, or privilege entered into on a national securities exchange relating to foreign currency, or in general, any instrument commonly known as a security, or any certificate of interest or participation in, temporary or interim certificate for, receipt for, or warrant or right to subscribe to or purchase, any of the foregoing; but shall not include currency or any note, draft, bill of exchange, or bankers' acceptance which has a maturity at the time of issuance of not exceeding nine months, exclusive of days of grace, or any renewal thereof the maturity of which is likewise limited." .

These codes were created by the U.S. government in 1937 to facilitate analysis of economic activity across government agencies and within industries. They were mostly replaced in 1997 by a new system of six-digit codes called the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS). The new codes were adopted in part to standardize industry data collection and analysis in between Canada, the United States and Mexico which had entered into the North American Free Trade Agreement. Note that certain organizations, such as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) still use SIC codes for some purposes." .

Semantic Modeling note This term is over-ridden for specific kinds of debt (securities, loans) and is therefore not needed in any data model. It is included here to define part of the meaning of the Debt Finance term. It is a Relationship Fact and strictly speaking should be regarded as being specialized and over-ridden by the terms in the Loan and Security classes, however it is modeled here as a \"Referenceable Archetype\" meaning that it appears in diagrams as a textual entry not a relationship line, and so it is not possible to formally show this specialization." .

The meaning is that a schedule stub comprises a date period and an event which is scheduled to occur during that date period; in other words that an Occurrence of the OccurrenceKind should happen during the DatePeriod of the ScheduleStub." ;

If the mortgage does not start on the first day of a calendar month, then an initial ScheduleStub specifies the payment due for the DatePeriod up to the first day of the next calendar month. Similarly, a final ScheduleStub specifies the last payment due for the DatePeriod after the end of the last full calendar month." .

                "Note that this does not necessarily imply that an agent is free to act as it sees fit, without constraint. Rather, an autonomous thing in the sense meant here is something which may or may not be subject to controls and constraints but is self-actualizing in its behavior in response to any such constraints. Autonomous things may include human beings, organizations, software agents, robots and animals." , "Agents, then, can be software agents, hardware agents, firmware agents, robotic agents, human agents, and so on. While software developers naturally think of IT systems as being constructed of only software agents, a combination of agent mechanisms might in fact be used from shop-floor manufacturing to warfare systems. The definition incorporated herein must be sufficiently general to account for these and other uses, such as for describing people and organizations who participate in broader processes and systems, for FIBO, other OMG standards and usage, and in general.\n\nWhether or not you restrict your view of agents to the software variety, most agree that agents deployed for IT systems are not useful without the following three important properties:\n\n(1) Autonomous - an agent is capable of acting without direct external intervention. Agents have some degree of control over their internal state and can act based on their own experiences. They can also possess their own set of internal responsibilities and processing that enable them to act without any external choreography. When an agent acts on behalf of (or as a proxy for) some person or thing, its autonomy is expected to embody the goals and policies of the entity that it represents.\n\n(2) Interactive - an agent communicates with the environment and other agents. Agents are interactive entities because they are capable of exchanging rich forms of messages with other entities in their environment. These messages can support requests for services and other kinds of resources, as well as event detection and notification. They can be synchronous or asynchronous in nature. The interaction can also be conversational in nature, such as negotiating contracts, marketplace-style bidding, or simply making a query.\n\n(3) Adaptive - an agent is capable of responding to other agents and/or its environment. Agents can react to messages and events and then respond appropriately. Agents can be designed to make difficult decisions and even modify their behavior based on their experiences. They can learn and evolve." ;

A geometric mean is often used when comparing different items - finding a single 'figure of merit' for these items - when each item has multiple properties that have different numeric ranges. For example, the geometric mean can give a meaningful 'average' to compare two companies which are each rated at 0 to 5 for their environmental sustainability, and are rated at 0 to 100 for their financial viability. If an arithmetic mean were used instead of a geometric mean, the financial viability is given more weight because its numeric range is larger - so a small percentage change in the financial rating (e.g. going from 80 to 90) makes a much larger difference in the arithmetic mean than a large percentage change in environmental sustainability (e.g. going from 2 to 5)." .

                "Most repos are overnight transactions, with the sale taking place one day and being reversed the next day. Long-term repos - called term repos - can extend for a month or more. Usually, repos are for a fixed period of time, but open-ended deals are also possible. Reverse repo is a term used to describe the opposite side of a repo transaction. The party who sells and later repurchases a security is said to perform a repo. The other party - who purchases and later resells the security - is said to perform a reverse repo. While a repo functions like the sale and subsequent repurchase of a security, but the legal reality and the economic effect is that of a secured loan. This is a loan as the original owner retains the rights to the cashflows of the underlying security. Economically, the party purchasing the security makes funds available to the seller and holds the security as collateral. If the repurchased security pays a dividend, coupon or partial redemptions during the repo, the funds are returned to the original owner. The difference between the sale and repurchase prices paid for the security represent interest on the loan. Indeed, repos are quoted as interest rates. A repo always pays interest at maturity, i.e. there are no periodic interest payments."@en .

The number will appear on an identity document issued by a country.\n\nThe ways in which such a system is implemented are dependent on the country, but in most cases, a citizen is issued an identification number at birth or when they reach a legal age (typically the age of 18). Non-citizens may be issued such numbers when they enter the country, or when granted a temporary or permanent residence permit.\n\nMany countries issued such numbers ostensibly for a singular purpose, but over time, they become a de facto national identification number. For example, the United States originally developed its Social Security number system as a means of disbursing Social Security benefits. However, due to function creep, the number has become utilized for other purposes to the point where it is almost essential to have one to, among other things, open a bank account, obtain a credit card, or drive a car." ;

In the US, by regulation, lender is required to respot person's payment history on a monthly basis. This is the basis on which peope's score is changed. So the lender's reporting to the credit bureau may affect that person's credit rating. this may give rise to credit disputes. Also there is a scenario where the borrower may contact the lender and ask for some change. For student loans, they can apply for a deferment payment based on change in circumstances e.g. if losing job, or becoming disabled, then there are specific programs which they can apply for. can defer paymen for a time, and if proven eligible (e.g. also if in military, being deployed), then if they subbut the relevant document, they approve and change their repayment term, perhaps temporarily and then revert to the previously agreed terms. This results from the borrower contacting the lender."@en .

Examples of reusable identifiers include ticker symbols, and in the United States, vehicle license numbers, such as vanity plates that can be reassigned and moved from one car to another. Narrower constraints can be added to specific kinds of identifiers that are not reassignable and that identify exactly one thing, such as many national identifiers for people including passport numbers and, in the United States, social security numbers. Also, not all identifiers are explicitly defined in formal schemes, although they may be created or generated according to some formula." .

                "The standard methodology for a typical PPI is based on a Laspeyres price index with fixed quantities from an earlier base period. The construction of this index can be thought of in terms of selecting a basket of goods and services representative of base-period revenues, valuing this at base-period prices, and then repricing the same basket at current-period prices. The target PPI in this case is defined to be the ratio of these two revenues. Practicing statisticians use this methodology because it has at least three practical advantages. It is easily explained to the public, it can use often expensive and untimely weighting information from the date of the last (or an even earlier) survey or administrative source (rather than requiring sources of data for the current month), and it need not be revised if users accept the Laspeyres premise." , "Statistical agencies implement the Laspeyres index by putting it into price-relative (price change from the base period) and revenue-share (from the base period) format. In this form, the Laspeyres index can be written as the sum of base-period revenue shares of the items in the index times their corresponding price relatives. Statistical agency practice has introduced some approximations to the theoretical Laspeyres target due to a number of practical problems with producing the Laspeyres index exactly. For these and other pragmatic reasons, some agencies use alternatives depending on circumstances. See the IMF publication cited for a full explanation of the most commonly used approaches and trade-offs made for determining PPI." .

Holder of 75 percent of the stock has the power to change the articles and memorandum of association and the firms name, reduce the share capital, allow the firm to buy its own shares from other stockholders, and to shut down the business. One hundred percent stockholding of course gives total power under the corporate legislation." .

Such companies often are used when a grantor feels the trust company can do an equal or better job managing the assets than an individual person, or if the grantor does not know of anyone else who can act as trustee. Trust companies sometimes act as fiscal agents for corporations by attending to the registration and transfer of their stocks and bonds, serving as a trustee for their bond and mortgage creditors, and transacting general banking and loan business." .

                "See notes from SME Review and in MIG Provider. Applies to securitized pool, insures the lender. Additional note (IBM): there is a further application of this. When a lender takes a loan which is a where the value of the loan is greater than 80% of the value of the property, at that point it is required for the lender to also get a private mortgage insurance, so they are paying separately for the mortgage insurance so that if the borrower defaults above 80% then the mortgage insurance pays the loss. In the Loan Party Insurer (new \"Party\" type) you have Loan Party Insured Ratio (e.g. the 80% in the example above). These are different situations but the same principle. So this needs to be modeled for both. 30 June: Is this Lender or Borrower? since you have one lender and one borrower in a single loan, but multiple lenders in the case of packaging this up for a security - there are then multiple lenders and multiple borrowers. A similar kind of insurance exists in the one lender one borrower scenario i.e. the mortgage loan itself. There are two concepts here. the MIG thing was for bundling these. the MIG might apply across multiple contracts, but still be a fact about \"the\" contract? The notes about 80% above (IBM) are about the individual loan. ACTION: Tidy this up."@en .

This amount generally does not change and is thus referred to as notional.\n\t\t\n\t\tFor securities the nominal value is often referred to as the face or par value. This is the redemption price of the security and is normally stated on the front of that security. With respect to bonds and stocks, it is the stated value of an issued security, as opposed to its market value.\n\t\t\n\t\tWhen applied to a swap this is the amount used for calculating the actual value of the interest due. Also known as Notional Value when describing derivative contracts in the options, futures, and currency markets, this term is often used to value the underlying asset in a derivatives trade. It can be the total value of a position, how much value a position controls, or an agreed-upon amount in a contract.\n\n\t\tAn example is that a firm might have a variable rate loan on $100,000 but decide to swap only $40,000. The $40,000 is the notional amount of the swap and becomes the amount on which interest is paid." .

This ontology also defines some of the variants of these such as governmental constitutions and ordinances. Court of Law is also defined here." , "This ontology defines concepts related to contractual guaranty." , "This ontology defines general purpose concepts for representation of regulatory agencies, also known as regulatory authorities or regulators. Examples of financial industry regulatory agencies in the US include the Securities Exchange Commission, FINRA, and the FDIC, among others.

It is designed to be mappable to other date and time ontologies and specifications, such as the W3C Time Ontology in OWL (available at https://www.w3.org/TR/owl-time/), certain temporal elements in BFO 2020 (see https://basic-formal-ontology.org/bfo-2020.html), time concepts defined in schema.org, and the Object Management Group's Date Time Vocabulary (DTV) specification (available at https://www.omg.org/spec/DTV/), without the corresponding overhead or in some cases, issues. The concepts were originally derived from a number of date and time standards including ISO 8601:2004 Representation of Dates and Times. The ontology itself was derived from the Financial Industry Business Ontology (FIBO) Financial Dates ontology, with minor revisions to better reflect requirements for mapping to other ontologies." , "The text datatype ontology defines a custom datatype that combines language tagged and plain string values.

The ontology defines things which are conferred upon some entity by some legal instrument, and elaborates this into a number of specific capacities, responsibilities and powers, each of which forms the basis for many of the concepts used elsewhere in FIBO in defining legal personhood, executive powers and the like." , "This ontology defines a wide range of events relating to loans. These include legal proceedings, prepayments, and so forth." , "This ontology defines the concept of an agreement and roles that parties to an agreement play in the context of financial agreements. Agreements represent an understanding between parties, whereas contracts typically formalize such agreements." , "This ontology defines abstract concepts for assessments, evaluations, and outcomes, as the basis for various analysis, such as for business performance, compliance and risk." , "This ontology defines the fundamental concepts for companies incorporated by the issuance of shares. Terms defined in this ontology are those which are applicable to all such entities. Many of these concepts form the basis of the relationships of ownership and control which obtain between entities of this type." , "This ontology describes loan and mortgage loan products. A product as defined here is something marketed and offered for sale, in this case a loan, such that when a customer takes on the product, they become signatories to a corresponding loan contract. A loan product in this sense is a contractual , off-the-shelf product with terms corresponding to those in the actual contract when it is signed." , "This ontology defines the fundamental concepts for representing polities and government entities and their relations." , "This ontology defines a range of credit events, that is events in which some payment or payments are not made.

The terms in this ontology may be extended as necessary to represent specific types of trust, for example in the funds arena." , "This ontology defines legal personhood concepts. A legal person as defined here is any natural person or organization which is capable of accruing liability on its own part." , "This ontology defines the high level concept of a formal organization, which is purposefully underspecified to facilitate mapping to other organization ontologies, such as the W3C organization ontology, or others defined for specific business and financial services standards.

                "This ontology, based on ISO 639 as well as the language element of the Language Tag specified in BCP 47 (RFC 4646, RFC 4647), provides a systemic description of the vocabulary used for language representation, including natural and artificial languages. \n\nISO 639 provides two language codes, one as a two-letter code (ISO 639-1) and another as a three-letter code (ISO 639-2, ISO 639-3, ISO 639-5) for the representation of names of languages.  ISO 639-1 was devised primarily for use in terminology, lexicography, and linguistics.  ISO 639-2 represents all of the languages contained in ISO 639-1, additional languages and language groups, as they may be coded for special purposes when more specificity in coding is needed.  The languages listed in ISO 639-1 are a subset of the languages listed in ISO 639-2; every language code element in the two-letter code has a corresponding language code element in the three-letter code, but not necessarily vice versa.  ISO 639-4 provides the basis for describing languages, as defined in this ontology, and additional codes are provided in 639-5 and other parts of the standard, again with more details about macrolanguages, other lesser known independent languages, and special language groups.\n\nISO 639-3 extends the set of three-letter codes provided in 639-2 to cover all of the natural, human languages in use today, along with many well-known ancient, extinct, and historical languages, including written and signed languages.  It also identifies the codes found in 639-2 that represent families or groups of languages rather than a single human language, depending on the perspective of the consumer.\n\nThe Registration Authority for ISO 639-1 is the International Information Centre for Terminology, ISO 639-1/RA.  This organization is responsible for maintenance of Part-1, and more information can be found at http://www.infoterm.info/standardization/iso_639_1_2002.php, although the actual code set is maintained by the US Library of Congress, together with the code set for ISO 639-2.\n\nThe Registration Authority for ISO 639-2 is the Library of Congress, ISO 639-2/RA.  The Library of Congress is responsible for maintenance of Part-2, at http://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/iso639-2ra.html.  Current code sets for ISO 639-1 and ISO 639-2 are available from this site, as mentioned above.  In addition to the material covered in the basic standard, the Library of Congress also publishes the German names for all languages, which is reflected in the properties given below.  See http://loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/php/code_list.php for the latest release.\n\nThe Registration Authority for ISO 639-3 is SIL International, ISO 639-3/RA.  SIL International is responsible for maintenance of Part-3, and more information can be found at http://www.sil.org/iso639-3/default.asp.\n\nThe codes included herein also correspond to the language element of the Language Tag specified in BCP 47 (RFC 4646, RFC 4647), and can be used for matching or other application development purposes (e.g., use of language identifier literals in applications that build up the RFC 4646 based tags).\n\nThis ontology (Language Representation) defines the model for the standard, based in part on ISO 639-4, with individual codes for the other parts of the standard represented in dependent models." , "The purpose of the Country Representation ontology, based on ISO 3166 and other representations of geographic regions and countries, such as the ISO Online Browsing Platform, UN M49 Region codes, SWIFT registry, UN FAO and CIA World Factbook, FIPA and International Olympics codes for countries, and GeoNames, is to provide a systematic description of the vocabulary used for country and geopolitical entity representation (based strictly on requirements for business applications, not broader geographic or political uses). A few additional properties to support geophysical coordinates, identified in the UN FAO and CIA World Factbook as well as from the well-known GeoNames ontology, have been added, but extensions to support other coding systems, such as the FAOSTAT code, have not been included.\n\nISO 3166 provides widely, though not universally, applicable coded representations of names of countries, dependencies, and other areas of particular geopolitical interest and their subdivisions.\n - ISO 3166-1 (Country codes) establishes codes that represent the current names of countries, dependencies, and other areas of particular geopolitical interest, on the basis of lists of country names obtained from the United Nations.\n - ISO 3166-2 (Country subdivision code) establishes a code that represents the names of the principal administrative divisions, or similar areas, of the countries, etc. included in the ISO 3166-1.\n - ISO 3166-3 (Code for formerly used names of countries) establishes a code that represents non-current country names, i.e., the country names deleted from ISO 3166 since its first publication in 1974.\n \nThe United Nations Standard Country or Area Codes for Statistical Use (M49), described at https://unstats.un.org/unsd/methodology/m49/, provides further regional classification for countries by continent, region within a continent, and sub-regions within regions that are widely used as well, and so this ontology is designed to support the M49 code set as well.  M49 reuses the ISO 3166 codes for countries and some regions, and augments that with additional, broader regional codes.\n\nThis ontology provides a reference model to support the first two parts of ISO 3166, along with the other coding systems mentioned above." , "This ontology represents the subset of the ISO 3166 standard that include the actual ISO 3166-1 country codes, with the ontology and codes for the other parts of the standard represented in dependent models." ;

                "(1) The present version of the ontology covers the English sections of the ISO 4217 standard only, and (2) UTF-8 character encodings are employed in names in the currency codes ontology to support the broadest number of tools." ;
        <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#historyNote>
                "This ontology is ultimately intended to represent all of ISO 639 for reference purposes, and to be sufficiently extensible to accommodate new sections or modifications as they are published. The current version of the ontology (including subordinate modules containing the language names and codes) provides a unique English name (i.e., the reference name from 639-3) for each language, with UTF-8 encoded literals specifying alternates in English, French, and Indigenous languages where present in the standard, and in German corresponding to the names on the LoC web site.\n\n1.  Where multiple English names occur in 639-1 and 639-2, we have used the primary name specified in 639-2:1998 superseded by the latest revision posted by the registration authority, or, where multiples are specified by the registration authority, the reference name from ISO 639-3 as the 'named individual name' for a given language. For languages specified in ISO 639-1, there is at least one English name and at least one French name for every language, corresponding to exactly one alpha-2 code.  Most languages from ISO 639-1 have at least one indigenous name.  Most languages with codes available from the Library of Congress also have at least one German name.  The correspondence between the alpha-2 codes and languages are made explicit in the individuals representing the codes themselves, and can be inferred for the languages using an OWL DL reasoner.\n\n2.  This release of the ontology covers all languages specified in parts 1 and 2 of the standard, and categorizes the alpha-3 codes from part 2 according to the categorization scheme provided in parts 3 and 4.  Subsequent releases of the ontology will address additional languages covered in part 3, as well as additional components of the standard, such as equivalence to standards representing relevant scripts, as they become available, and the language groups covered by ISO 639-5.\n\n3.  We have used individuals to represent all alpha-2 and alpha-3 codes, which, in turn, have matching strings (tags) associated with them for use in a variety of applications to facilitate reasoning and mapping.  The strings are provided as datatype properties of the individuals to support applications that may require them for RFC 4646-style tagging.\n  \n4.  Note that some tools, including certain UML tools, are case insensitive.  Thus, in cases where a language name collides with an alpha-2 or alpha-3 code, (i.e., Ga, Ewe, Fon, Ido, Lao, Tiv, Twi, Vai, and Yao), the names for the individual codes have been extended with '_1' (e.g., 'ewe_1').\n\n5.  We found a few anomalies in the standards while developing this ontology.  These include: \n(1) Bihari is included in the 2002 version of 639-1, in the 1998 version of 639-2, and in the online codes posted by the Library of Congress in 2007 for parts 1 and 2, with part 1 code of 'bh' and part 2 bibliographic and terminology codes of 'bih'.  At that time, there was no discussion stating that Bihari is a collective language, although it was omitted from the downloadable data for 639-3.  Since then, the language element has been renamed 'Bihari languages', in both English and French, without change to the corresponding language codes.  The latest version of the code sets reflect this modification.  Our assumption is that the trigraph for Bihari is a collective language code, which is supported by online research in Eastern Indic languages.\n(2) Serbo-Croatian was included in the 2002 version of 639-1, with part 1 code 'sh'.  It was not mentioned in the 1998 version of 693-2, but appears in 639-3 with a language identifier of 'hbs', without codes for 639-2.  As of 2010, Serbo-Croation has been eliminated from ISO 639-1 and 639-2 codes altogether, and the ontology reflects this.\n(3) Other changes in the latest version of the ontology include elimination of the 639-1 code for Moldavian, merging the language with Romanian, and additional English and French names for some languages, such as Dutch (to include Flemish, flamais), among others.\n(4) German names for languages in ISO 639-2 were added to the Library of Congress in 2014, and are supported in this version of the ontology.\n\n6.  The LCC 1.0 version of this ontology, published in advance of the 2017 New Orleans OMG Technical Meeting, was current as of 31 July 2017 with respect to the ISO 639-1 and 639-2 codes included herein." ;

In most cases, lenders will also charge a spread, or added percentage points on top of the established index rate. If a loan is billed as prime plus 2.5 percent, for a prime rate of 3.5 percent, the terms of the loan will require the borrower to pay off a 6 percent interest. Floating interest rates typically involve periodic reset dates for the loan, particularly when the index rate changes. Resets may also occur online at market predetermined intervals, with yearly adjustments being a common arrangement." .

When you get into indemnification, then for instance if the product doesn't meet the investor's requirement such that if it doesn't get paid then the lender steps in and takes the hit for the loan - this is usually a precondition for securitizing (issuing) the loan in a pool. If the loan is not going to be sold on the secondary market there would be no need to indemnify that loan so this term would not apply. Indemnification is insurance for the investor, while the lender is the one providing that indemnification."@en .

                "This is a schedule for one of the events that occur in a periodic schedule of interest accruals, interest payments, and (for floating rate swapstreams), changes to the interest rate. These may be specified individually but more commonly the Calculation event is the one scheduled according to this kind of parametric schedule, with the other dates specified as an offset to these. Here we have allowed for each of the related dates to be independently parametrically scheduled. The notional amount step schedule is a separate kind of schedule, with similar terms but without a period length. For calculation schedules (and possibly payments, resets), there is a different end date to the end /start of the period, since events may be specified as being on specific dates - this is where the Roll Convention comes in. This has the same basic concepts as the generic schedule shown as the parent to this. However, where the upper model has Date with various applicable sub types (known i.e. calendar, specified or determined). For example, an ISDA FpML schedule has a Specified Date (via a convention), and then has a date roll rule which is specified for the whole schedule and applies to each of the dates returned by the parametric specification of the schedule. It has: A schedule beginning and end; A set of regular repeating periods: the scheduled event takes place once per period; Optionally one or two stubs (one start and one end); these may be longer than the repeating period, or shorter. The precise parameters used are: Start of the overall Schedule period: Effective Date End of the overall Schedule period: Termination Date Start of first regular period: not specified (assume Effective Date?) Length of each regular period: Frequency (actually a duration) There are generally three ways in which the regular periods of a parametric schedule may be expressed: first plus last first plus period length last plus period length event date plus period length. In FpML, Roll events (the date that something rolls over from the value used in one period to the value used in the next) is defined in a Roll Convention, which may be a day of the month, a day of the week, or some published set of dates, typically the ISDA quarterly dates for these events. This is therefore the date within the regular period (before adjustments) when the event occurs. This is in addition so a date for the start or end of such a period. In general this applies to the Calculation Schedule (i.e. the event is the calculation event) with other dates specified relative to this, however in principle the other related events (payment and reset or refix) are specified relative to this. It is not immediately clear what specification of a date replaces the Roll event convention element when this happens." .

Although charities do comprise an often high profile or visible aspect of the sector, there are many other types of nonprofits. Overall, they tend to be either member-serving or community-serving. Member-serving organizations include mutual societies, cooperatives, trade unions, credit unions, industry associations, sports clubs, retired serviceman's clubs and other organizations that benefit a particular group of people - the members of the organization. Typically, community-serving organizations are focused on providing services to the community in general, either globally or locally: organizations delivering human services programs or projects, aid and development programs, medical research, education and health services, and so on." ;

Clearing relates to identifying the obligations of both parties on either side of a transaction. Settlement occurs when the final transfer of securities and funds occur.\n\nCCPs benefit both parties in a transaction because they bear most of the credit risk. If two individuals deal with one another, the buyer bears the credit risk of the seller, and vice versa. When a CCP is used the credit risk that is held against both buyer and seller is coming from the CCP, which in all likelihood is much less than in the previous situation." .

                "For British or Commonwealth companies, a privately held company limited by shares is a type of company incorporated under the laws of England and Wales, Scotland, certain Commonwealth countries and the Republic of Ireland. It has shareholders with limited liability and its shares may not be offered to the general public, unlike those of public limited companies. Limited by shares means that the company has shareholders, and that the liability of the shareholders to creditors of the company is limited to the capital originally invested, i.e. the nominal value of the shares and any premium paid in return for the issue of the shares by the company. A shareholders personal assets are thereby protected in the event of the company's insolvency, but money invested in the company will be lost. A limited company may be private or public. A private limited companys disclosure requirements are lighter, but for this reason its shares may not be offered to the general public (and therefore cannot be traded on a public stock exchange). This is the major distinguishing feature between a private limited company and a public limited company. Most companies, particularly small companies, are private. Private companies limited by shares are required to have the suffix Limited (often written Ltd or Ltd.) or Incorporated (Inc.) as part of their name, though the latter cannot be used in the UK or the Republic of Ireland. In the Republic of Ireland, Teoranta (Teo.) may be used instead, largely by Gaeltacht companies. Cyfyngedig (Cyf.) may be used by Welsh companies in a similar fashion." ;
